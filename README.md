# Bamboo.SMTPAdapter

An Adapter for the [Bamboo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo) email app.

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

1. Add `bamboo_smtp` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:bamboo_smtp, "~> 1.6.0"}]
  end
  ```

2. Add `bamboo` and `bamboo_smtp` to your list of applications in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def application do
    [applications: [:bamboo, :bamboo_smtp]]
  end
  ```

3. Setup your SMTP configuration:

  ```elixir
  # In your config/config.exs file
  config :my_app, MyApp.Mailer,
    adapter: Bamboo.SMTPAdapter,
    server: "smtp.domain",
    hostname: "your.domain",
    port: 1025,
    username: "your.name@your.domain", # or {:system, "SMTP_USERNAME"}
    password: "pa55word", # or {:system, "SMTP_PASSWORD"}
    tls: :if_available, # can be `:always` or `:never`
    allowed_tls_versions: [:"tlsv1", :"tlsv1.1", :"tlsv1.2"], # or {":system", ALLOWED_TLS_VERSIONS"} w/ comma seprated values (e.g. "tlsv1.1,tlsv1.2")
    ssl: false, # can be `true`
    retries: 1,
    no_mx_lookups: false, # can be `true`
    auth: :if_available # can be `always`. If your smtp relay requires authentication set it to `always`.
  ```

*Sensitive credentials should not be committed to source control and are best kept in environment variables.
Using `{:system, "ENV_NAME"}` configuration is read from the named environment variable at runtime.*

The *hostname* option sets the FQDN to the header of your emails, its optional, but if you don't set it, the underlying `gen_smtp` module will use the hostname of your machine, like `localhost`.
